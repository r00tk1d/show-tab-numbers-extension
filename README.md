# Tab Number Display Chromium Extension

The **Tab Number Display** extension enhances your browsing by showing tab numbers in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2], etc.) next to tab titles. This is useful for using `Ctrl + Number` shortcuts to switch between tabs. The extension updates tab numbers when tabs are created, moved, updated, or closed. Numbers 1 to 8 are displayed for the first eight tabs. The number 9 is displayed only on the last tab.
