# Tab Number Display Chromium Extension

## Overview

The **Tab Number Display** extension enhances your browsing by showing tab numbers in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2], etc.) next to tab titles. This is useful for using `Ctrl + Number` shortcuts to switch between tabs. The extension updates tab numbers when tabs are created, moved, updated, or closed.

## Installation

1. **Download the Extension Files**
   - Download or clone the extension files to your local machine.

2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Google Chrome (or `brave://extensions/` in Brave).

3. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Toggle "Developer mode" on in the top right corner.

4. **Load the Unpacked Extension**
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned folder.

## Usage

- Use `Ctrl + Number` shortcuts (`Ctrl + 1`, `Ctrl + 2`, etc.) to navigate to the corresponding tabs.
- Numbers 1 to 8 are displayed for the first eight tabs. The number 9 is displayed only on the last tab. Tabs beyond the first eight (except the last tab) will not display numbers because you can only navigate to tabs with numbers 1 to 8 and the last tab with 9.
